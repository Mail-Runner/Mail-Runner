# Hello there, I'm Liam Mazur üëã

## About Me

I'm an aspiring **Geospatial Data Analyst** and **GIS Technician** with a diverse background in secondary social studies education, archaeology, and geospatial research.

After three rewarding years teaching history and geography as a secondary social studies teacher in rural Colorado, I've returned to the GIS sphere that first captivated me during my tenure as an archaeology student. As I seek a new role in GIS, I'm dedicated to helping organizations navigate complex challenges and drive positive change on local, national, and global scales using dynamic geographic information systems and spatial data analysis.
